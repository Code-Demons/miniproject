    "Our goal is to create an olympics for sorting algorithms and fibionachi sequences. We want to represent each sorting algorithm as a different athlete in the olympics: bubble, insertion, selection, and merge. And have each of the athletes compete agianst each other in different events representing different types of data sets to show how different sorting algorithms are better for different types of data: long, short, fully random, partially organized, etc."
